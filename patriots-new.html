    <p>The <b>New England Patriots</b> are a professional <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football">American football</a> team based in the Greater
        Boston area. They
        compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's American Football Conference
        (AFC) East division. The team plays its home games at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, which is 22
        miles (35 km)[5] southwest of downtown Boston.</p>


    <p>Founded in 1959 as the Boston Patriots, the team was a charter member of the American Football League (AFL)
        before joining the NFL in 1970 through the AFLâ€“NFL merger. The Patriots played their home games at various
        stadiums throughout Boston until the franchise moved to Foxborough in 1971. As part of the move, the team
        changed its name to the New England Patriots. Home games were played at Foxboro Stadium until 2002 when the
        stadium was demolished alongside the opening of Gillette Stadium. The team began utilizing Gillette Stadium for
        home games the same year.</p>

<h3>Uniforms</h3>
<h4>1960-1992</h4>
<h4>1993-present</h4>
<h4><u>Alternate uniforms</u></h4>
<p>In 1994, the Patriots wore the "Pat Patriot" helmets and plain white striped pants from two seasons prior as
    alternates as part of the NFL's 75th-anniversary celebration. In 2002, NFL teams were allowed to add a permanent
    third jersey to be worn in a maximum of two games. The Patriots reintroduced a red jersey as their alternate,
    complemented with the old-style "Pat Patriot" helmet.[31] In 2003, the Patriots changed their alternate to a
    silver jersey with blue pants. For this uniform, the "Flying Elvis" helmet was used.[31] The uniform was
    identical to the white jersey with any areas of white replaced by silver. These uniforms were dropped after
    2007. No alternate uniform was used in 2008. In 2009, the red alternate was reintroduced, again accompanied by
    the "Pat Patriot" helmet. An alternate white road jersey was also worn with the older helmet for one game, using
    red numbers, in tribute to the 50th anniversary of the AFL. The red alternate gained a blue outline around the
    numbers in 2010 and this was worn through 2012. The Patriots retired their alternate red uniforms in 2013,
    thanks to a new NFL rule outlawing throwback alternate helmets, and restricting teams to one helmet shell
    only.[39]</p>
<p>In 2016, the Patriots took part in the NFL's Color Rush program, wearing monochrome navy uniforms on September 22
    against the Houston Texans.[40] The uniform tops were patterned after the 1980s Pat Patriot-era uniforms, while
    the pants featured thick white stripes with red accents. They have worn them a total of four times since 2016.
    In 2017, an all-white Color Rush uniform was introduced and used for the Patriots' Thursday night road game
    against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Test</p>
